  <page id="1" content="Your footsteps crunch on the dried leaves that blanket the forest floor. A gust briefly whips the leaves into the air, obscuring your vision. As they settle, you see the trees thin ahead.\n\nYou enter the clearing, clutching your small knife firmly in your hand. The blood running from the wound in your shoulder threatens to loose your grip, but you're confident that your resolve is enough to deliver a lethal blow regardless.\n\nYet you hesitate. Are you truly ready for what awaits you in the foreign ruins that lie before you?" choice1="Yes, I'm ready." choice2="No, I was too afraid to go on. Let some other bastard die in a spike pit trap." choice3="I should probably check my supplies once more to be sure I'm ready." choice1Result="2" choice2Result="3" choice3Result="4" image="adventure"></page>

  <page id="3" content="You turn around and fall into a spike pit. You take 95 points of damage." choice1="Bleed out." choice2="Cry for help and bleed out." choice3="Resign yourself to your fate and bleed out." choice1Result="8" choice2Result="9" choice3Result="10" image="adventure"></page>
  <page id="4" content="You kneel and remove your backpack from your tired shoulders. Your posessions are few, but you take several minutes to look them over, taking advantage of the reprieve. Suddenly, you see movement. Did something just dash from the ruins and head East?" choice1="I must have been imagining it... Enter the ruins anyway." choice2="Yes, follow him East!" choice3="I don't want any trouble, I think I'll head West instead." choice1Result="2" choice2Result="12" choice3Result="13" image="adventure"></page>
